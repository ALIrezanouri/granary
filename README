This is a conversion library and proxy ActivityStreams server for sites that
don't support the ActivityStreams format and API themselves. It currently has
implementations for Facebook and Twitter, served at these endpoints:

http://facebook-activitystreams.appspot.com/
http://twitter-activitystreams.appspot.com/

Feel free to add more!

Background on ActivityStreams:
http://activitystrea.ms/
http://wiki.activitystrea.ms/

The REST API is based on OpenSocial's Activity Streams API:
http://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/2.0.1/Social-API-Server.xml#ActivityStreams-Service

Request paths are of the form /user_id/group_id/app_id/activity_id, where
each element is optional. user_id may be @me. group_id may be @all, @friends
(currently identical to @all), or @self. app_id may be @app, but it doesn't
matter, it's currently ignored.

The supported query parameters are startIndex and count, which are handled as
described in OpenSocial (above) and OpenSearch.

As precedent, Cliqset's FeedProxy used to do this, but unfortunately it and
Cliqset died:

Facebook used to officially support ActivityStreams, but that's also dead:

Twitter and Facebook support OAuth, which you'll need to use for pretty much
everything. If you obtain an OAuth access token from Twitter or Facebook and
include it in a request to this provider, it will be used to sign and authorize
the underlying requests to those providers. See the demos on
https://facebook-activitystreams.appspot.com/ and
https://twitter-activitystreams.appspot.com/ for examples.

To use this in a ActivityStreams client, you'll need to hard-code exceptions
for the facebook.com and twitter.com hosts and redirect ActivityStreams HTTP
requests to the corresponding endpoint above.

Note the app.yaml.* files, one for each App Engine app id. To work on or deploy
a specific app id, symlink app.yaml to its app.yaml.xxx file. Likewise, if you
add a new site, you'll need to add a corresponding app.yaml.xxx file.

The tests require the App Engine SDK and python-mox.

Deploy commands:
rm -f app.yaml && ln -s app.yaml.twitter app.yaml && \
  ~/google_appengine/appcfg.py --oauth2 update . && \
rm -f app.yaml && ln -s app.yaml.facebook app.yaml && \
  ~/google_appengine/appcfg.py --oauth2 update .
